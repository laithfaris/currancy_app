a. Instructions on how to build the project.

first of all you need to know which pattern and the state management you want to use, as I am didnt have experince in clean arti and bloc i start to know what i need from them to build the app after that i get the api , build the logic at least i build the ui

b. Adapted design pattern for the app architecture with justification on why to choose it.

i used bloc pattern with clean architecture for two reason 1)cuz you asked me to do it in it 2)its easy to modify or adding any new feature

c. Adapted image loader library with justification on why to choose it.

i didnt use any image loder cuz i was not need it

d. Used database in the app with justification on why to choose it.

i used GetStorage cuz 1)its didnt ask for permission 2)its a small data that why i didnt use sqflite 3)i didnt need await to get the data i can call it from any where

note: i didnt write a unit test cuz i get alot of issues from the api cuz the response change , i start again to handle it and the response that retrive has a weird syntax and i spent alot of time just to handle it .
I used 163 req im still having 137 req
